This **Wednesday 19 February** in Plymouth Lecture Theatre at 4pm [Dr Alejandro Sánchez-Amaro](https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/1971770) from the University of Stirling will give our School Research Seminar on the *Determinants of competitive and prosocial behaviour in captive chimpanzees*. Chimpanzees need to constantly navigate conflicts with others to reap the benefits of social living. They cultivate strong bonds through grooming and other prosocial behaviours in order to outcompete others for social status. Such competition, supported by the creation of social bonds through affiliative and prosocial behaviours, seems to be the main driving force of chimpanzee sociality. In fact, many experimental studies have showed chimpanzees exceptional abilities to out-manoeuvre others for competitive goals as well as to engage in prosocial tasks to generate benefits for others. But although these studies have helped us understand chimpanzees motivational and cognitive capacities for social skills, studies in captivity rarely consider the social contexts in which chimpanzees live in. That is, how social variables such as kinship, the rank relation between the participants, or the strength of their affiliation may affect chimpanzees' performance in these tasks. We evaluated the effect of these variables in a large collection of competitive and prosocial tasks conducted at the Wolfgang Kohler Primate Research Centre in the Leipzig Zoo. Our findings suggest that social parameters such as rank relation, gender and bonding relation greatly influence chimpanzees performance to compete and act prosocial in these tasks.

[Dr Gustav Kuhn](http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/staff/gustav-kuhn) was interviewed by the [Day 6 programme](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6) of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation about his interest in magic's deceptive elements, and how it  led him to study psychology and explore the human mind using the principles of magic. In November last year, he launched the [Auditory Magic Challenge,](https://www.magicresearchlab.com/auditorychallange) which aims to create a magic trick relying solely on auditory perception. in the interview Dr. Kuhn explains what contributors came up with and how it might help make magic a more inclusive experience.
